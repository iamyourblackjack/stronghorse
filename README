# 🐴 Stronghorse

A personal repository for practicing coding problems from LeetCode, HackerRank, and other competitive programming platforms.

## About

This repo serves as my training ground for:

- **LeetCode** problems (Easy → Hard)
- **Data Structures** implementations
- **Algorithm** practice and optimization
- **Interview prep** exercises

## Setup

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x p*.py

# Run a solution (tests included)
./p1_two_sum.py
```

## Structure

```text
p{number}_{name}.py  # Solution with tests baked in
```

## Progress

| Category | Solved |
|----------|--------|
| Easy     | 0      |
| Medium   | 0      |
| Hard     | 0      |

## Goals

- [ ] Solve 100 problems
- [ ] Master common patterns
- [ ] Improve time/space complexity intuition
